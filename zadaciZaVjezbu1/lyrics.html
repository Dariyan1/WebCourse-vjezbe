                  [Verse 1]
    You get a shiver in the dark
    It's raining in the park
    But meantime
    South of the river
    You stop and you hold everything
    A band is blowing Dixie
    Double four time
    You feel alright
    When you hear the music ring
           </i> </pre><br>
            <pre><i>
                   [Verse 2]
    Well, now you step inside
    But you don't see too many faces
    Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
    Competition in other places
    Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
    Way on down south
    Way on down south, London town
           </i> </pre><br>

                    [Verse 3]
    Check out guitar George
    He knows all the chords
    Mind, it's strictly rhythm
    He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
    Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
    When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

    People are strange when you're a stranger
    Faces look ugly when you're alone
    Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
    Streets are uneven when you're down
            </i></pre><br>
            <pre><i>
                   [Chorus]
    When you're strange
    Faces come out of the rain
    When you're strange
    No one remembers your name
    When you're strange
    When you're strange
    When you're strange
            </i></pre><br>

    When you're strange
    When you're strange
    When you're strange
    Alright, yeah
